It's that time of year again -- turkeys are being carved, delicious
cakes are being served, and people are fighting with each other over TVs at
Walmart.

I think it's very important that as we are giving thanks to so many
people at this time of year, that we take our time to thank the people
who build and maintain the programming infrastructure that
thousands of people rely on, on a daily basis.
Open source software is very important in sharing code and building on
top of each other for a better programming environment. Without this
vital work, we would each be using either proprietary enterprise
solutions, or rewriting the same web framework thirty times over.

Now is the time of year to consider what you can do for the open source projects
that you use on a daily basis. Reach out to the maintainer(s), and see
what you can do. Great community projects like [24 Pull
Requests](https://twitter.com/24PullRequests) and
similar events help to try and get new contributors invested in the
community. I urge you try and participate in these types of initiatives,
and do your part to help and work on the libraries you use everyday.

If you don't think that you would be able to donate your time to OSS,
then there is a way for you to donate your money instead! [Ruby
Together](https://twitter.com/rubytogether) is a great trade association
run by [André Arko](https://twitter.com/indirect) of the
[Bundler](http://bundler.io) project. Ruby Together pays developers to
work on key Ruby infrastructure like Bundler, RubyGems, and other
projects.

Below is a (non comprehensive) list of OSS projects I use constantly,
and their maintainers that I would like to thank:

* Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto and the Ruby Core Team for the [Ruby
  Programming Language](http://ruby-lang.org)
* David H. Hanson and the Rails Core Team for the [Ruby on Rails web
  framework](http://rubyonrails.org)
* Eric Hodel and the RubyGems Core Team for the [RubyGems packaging
  library](https://rubygems.org)
* André Arko and the Bundler Core Team for the [Bundler installation
  library](http://bundler.io)
* Sam Giddins for the [Molinillo dependency
  resolver](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Molinillo)
* Sam Phippen and the RSpec Core Team for the [RSpec testing
  library](https://github.com/rspec)
* Bozhidar Batsov for the [Rubocop code linting
  library](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)
* Tute Costa for the [Doorkeeper OAuth2
  library](https://github.com/doorkeeper-gem/doorkeeper)
* Jon Yurek for the [Paperclip attachment
  library](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip)
* Yehuda Katz, Tom Dale, and the Ember Core team for the [Ember.js
  frontend framework](http://emberjs.com)
