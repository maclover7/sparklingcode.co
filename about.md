Welcome to my blog! I post about whatever cool technical topics I am currently dealing with or working on. Since I am a Ruby developer, blog posts usually center around Ruby, Rails, or the surrounding ecosystem. I am more recently interested in Node.js and how it is organized as an open source project, so I have some posts about that. I am also a huge fan of devops services, like Flynn, Ansible, and Docker, that make it easier to self host applications.

If you ever want to get in touch with me, the best way is usually through email, or via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/applerebel).
